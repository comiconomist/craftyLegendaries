Description
===========
Have you ever wondered why people would settle in a place for the long haul, but not lift a finger to improve their living situation? Maybe they just didn't have anywhere to put all that rubbish surrounding them! This mod solves that problem, and enables your settlers to clean up after themselves!


Details
=======
This mod adds a rubbish bin as a new craftable, workable item for your settlements. When a settler is assigned to the bin, they will begin to clean up the random debris in a fairly large area (4096 unit diameter, the width of a game cell) around the bin. This will also increase the happiness of the settlement.

The debris will be tidied bit by bit over the course of several days (20-ish in most cases, but it depends on how dirty the area is). Even after everything has been tidied, keeping someone assigned to it will continue to add happiness to the settlement.  The bin can also be moved in order to change the focus of your settler's efforts.

You can build a rubbish bin from the Resources/Other section of your workshop menu (next to the scavenging station).

Items that will be tidied (I tried to keep it to items that cannot be scrapped manually):
-Ash Piles
-Bushes
-Bramble
-Branch Piles
-Fungus
-Goo Piles
-Hedges (but not the huge hedges like in Sanctuary)
-Mirelurk nests
-Piles of leaves, dirt, bricks, trash, etc.
-Plywood
-Roots
-Shrubs
-Skeletons
-Vines
-and all sorts of general debris and clutter (including 2D 'decals')

I definitely have not yet made an exhaustive search of all the settlements, so please let me know if there is any junk that you think should be tidied, but doesn't seem to be targetted yet (remember it may take ~20 in-game days to clean everything around the bin).

In the future, I may make this mod somewhat customizable so you can choose what types of items you do or do not want tidied, depending on user interest.


Incompatibility
===============
There shouldn't be any issues, as all objects and scripts are new.

Known Issues or Bugs
====================
Not really an 'issue', but be aware that the debris will not disappear while you are in a settlement.  It will however keep track of how much should be removed per day, so that when you leave and come back, the proper amount of junk will be gone even if you have stayed in one place for several days.
